# Container port shold match the app port ideally.

# RUN is like building a house (installing fixtures, painting walls)
# CMD is like what you do when you move in (turning on lights)

# Think of it as:

# RUN: "Do this as part of setup"
# CMD: "Do this to start the app"

# Currently we are using tsx to auto transpile our TS to JS.
# For final product we would need to change tsx to tsc for better perfomance.
# This means our code will be located in a different location then server. 
# It will most likely be located in ./dist 
# We need to change our tsconfig.json outDir to "./dist" (When project is ready for production).
# docker build -t my-server -f server/Dockerfile .
