# Q: how does this file relate to other files?
# A: Your App → Collector → Monitoring Tools
#   (tracing.ts) (otel-config.yml) (Jaeger/Prometheus)
# relevant documentation: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/
# Create folder: opentelemetry/otel-config.yml

# Receivers: Where data comes in
receivers:
  otlp: # OpenTelemetry protocol
    protocols:
      grpc: # For applications using gRPC
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 # Port where it listens
        #i commented out tls, it's a security encryption feature i dunno if we need?
        # tls:
        #   cert_file: cert.pem
        #   key_file: cert-key.pem
      http: # For applications using HTTP
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4319 # Port where it listens

# Processors: What to do with the data before sending
processors:
  batch: # Groups data into batches for efficiency
    timeout: 1s # Send at least every second
    send_batch_size: 1024 # Or when we have 1024 items

# Exporters: Where to send the processed data
exporters:
  jaeger: # Sends traces to Jaeger
    endpoint: jaeger:14250 # Docker service name & port
    tls:
      insecure: true # Dev setup - don't need security

  prometheus: # Sends metrics to Prometheus
    endpoint: '0.0.0.0:8889' # Where Prometheus can collect metrics
    namespace: 'your_app' # Groups metrics under this name

# Service: How everything connects together
#pipeline is where pipelines are configured and can be of types traces, metrics, or logs
#a pipeline is a set of receivers, processors, and exporters, each defined earlier in the file
service:
  pipelines:
    traces: # Pipeline for trace data
      receivers: [otlp] # Get data from receivers
      processors: [batch] # Process it
      exporters: [jaeger] # Send to Jaeger

    metrics: # Pipeline for metrics
      receivers: [otlp] # Get data from receivers
      processors: [batch] # Process it
      exporters: [prometheus] # Send to Prometheus
